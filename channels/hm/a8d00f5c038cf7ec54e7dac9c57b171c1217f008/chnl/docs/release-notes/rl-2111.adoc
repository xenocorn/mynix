[[sec-release-21.11]]
== Release 21.11

The 21.11 release branch became the stable branch in November, 2021.

[[sec-release-21.11-highlights]]
=== Highlights

This release has the following notable changes:

* All Home Manager modules are now loaded on all platforms. With this
change you will get a more descriptive error message if you attempt to
enable a module that is incompatible with the host platform.
+
Previously, modules that were platform specific would only be loaded
on that particular platform. For example, a module defining a
https://systemd.io/[systemd] service would only be loaded when the
host platform was Linux. This reduced evaluation times, simplified the
generated documentation, and made it impossible to accidentally use
modules that do not support the host platform.
+
While the above benefits are quite nice, avoiding module loads also
brings a few problems. For example, the
https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/[public documentation]
will only show the options available for Linux hosts and the
documentation cannot make references to options within modules that
are unavailable on some hosts. Finally, users who wish to use the same
configuration file for different platforms cannot do so, even if the
platform incompatible options are unused.
+
Ultimately, the benefits of loading all modules won and the behavior
has now changed. For associated discussion see
https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/issues/1906[issueÂ #1906].

* Rofi version 1.7.0 removed many options that were used by the module and replaced them with custom themes, which are more flexible and powerful.
+
You can replicate your old configuration by moving those options to <<opt-programs.rofi.theme>>. Keep in mind that the syntax is different so you may need to do some changes.

* Taskwarrior version 2.6.0 respects XDG Specification for the config file now.
Option <<opt-programs.taskwarrior.config>> and friends now generate the config file at
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/task/taskrc` instead of `~/.taskrc`.

=== State Version Changes

The state version in this release includes the changes below. These
changes are only active if the `home.stateVersion` option is set to
"21.11" or later.

* The <<opt-home.keyboard>> option now defaults to `null`, meaning that Home Manager won't do any keyboard layout management. For example, `setxkbmap` won't be run in X sessions.

* The <<opt-programs.pet.settings>> option no longer place its value inside a `General` attribute.
For example, is you before had
+
[source,nix]
programs.pet.settings.editor = "nvim";
+
then you now need
+
[source,nix]
programs.pet.settings.General.editor = "nvim";
